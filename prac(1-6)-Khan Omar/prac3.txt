Practical 3- Bresenhem's line Algo.
----------------------------------------
Bresenhem:
-Used to draw line primiive in bitmap image.
-Determines the pointd of n dimensional raster.//not necessary to learn.

Procedure:
1.Input the two line end-points, storing left end-pointd in (Xo,Yo)
2.Plot(Xo,Yo)
3.Cal.^x,^y,
  Get first decision parameter as Po=2^y-2^x
4.At each Xk, starting k=0,perform:
  if(Pk<0)
next point to plot is (Xk+1,Yk) and Pk+1=Pk+2^y
else
(Xk+ 1,Yk + 1) and Pk+1 = Pk +2^y-2^x
5 Repeat step 4 (^x) times. //That implies for loop for(k=0;k < ^x;k++)

Desicion parameter:
A criteria based on which further calculations are made.

Advantages of Bresenhem over DDA:
1. DDA uses float numbers and uses operators such as division and multiplication in its calculation
2. Due to the use of only addition, subtraction and bit shifting Bresenhams algorithm is faster than DDA in producing the line.
