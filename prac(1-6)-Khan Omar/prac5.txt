Practical 5: Fill Polygon
-----------------------------
-Polygon is chain of connected line segments.
-Floodfil also known as seed fill,
 determines the area connected to a given node in a multi-dimensional array.
 suitable for filling multiple boundary.
 
-In flood fill we start with some seed and examine the neighbouring pixel,
 however pixel are checked and replaced with a new color that does not matches with boundary color.
 It can be done using 4 connected or 8 connected region method.

Procedure:
Flood_fill(node,target_color,replacement_color):
1-If(target_color==replacement_color){return}
2-If(node_color!=replacement_color){return}
3-//set node_color=replacement_color
4-Perform Flood_fill(one step to south of node,target_color,replacement_color)
  Perform Flood_fill(one step to north of node,target_color,replacement_color)
  Perform Flood_fill(one step to west of node,target_color,replacement_color)
  Perform Flood_fill(one step to east of node,target_color,replacement_color)
5-Return.
  ex.
	circle(100,100,50);
	Flood_fill(100,100,RED);

Types of Polygon:
    -Regular polygon.
    -Irregular polygon.
    -Convex polygon.
    -Concave polygon.
    -Trigons.
    -Quadrilateral polygon.
    -Pentagon polygon.
    -Hexagon polygon.

Inside-Outside test:
Inside–outside test, a test used in computer graphics to determine if a point is inside or outside of a polygon.
If the point is on the outside of the polygon the ray will intersect its edge an even number of times.

4 connected & 8 connected:
4-connected region: from a given pixel you can get to any other pixel in the region by a series of 4 way moves (up, down,left, right). 
8-connected region: from a given pixel you can get to any other pixel in the region by a series of 8 way moves (up, down,left, right, up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right).
