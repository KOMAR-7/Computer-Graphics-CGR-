Practical 1:
-------------------------------
#include<graphics> --> header file for graphics program.

-void initgrapgh(int *graphdriver,int grapgh mode,char pathtodriver) -->used to change from text mode to graphic mode.
		//above mentioned inside brackets are parameters.

-detectgraph() --> used to find out graphics driver and graphics mode.

-void closegraph() --> this function is used to close the graphic mode,
		       it deallocates the memory allocated by graphics system and restores screen in textmode.
-putpixel(int x, int y,color) --> function used to draw pixel at given location(x,y).

-line(int x1, int y1,int x2,int y2) --> draw a line from starting point(x1,y1) to end point(x2,y2).

-circle(int x,int y,int radius) -->draw circle with center(x,y) to the radius.

-rectangle(int left,int top,int right,int bottom) --> draw rectangle.co-ordinates of left-top and bottom right required.

-ellipse(int x,int y,start angle,end angle,int xradius,int yradius) --> draw ellipse with center(x,y).
					   //radius of x,radius of y

-outtextxy(int x,int y,"text") --> used to insert text at gien position(x,y).

Graphic driver: the software that allow your operating system and programs to use your computer's graphics hardware.
Graphic mode:Graphics mode is a computer display mode that generates image using pixels.

Application of CGR.:
1.Computer Art.
2.Visualisation.
3.Image Processing.
4.Presentation Graphics.

Raster Scan Graphics:
The rectangular pattern of image capture and reconstruction in television.
Line:
A single point that continues for a distance
