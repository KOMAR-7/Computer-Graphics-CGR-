Practical 2: DDA Line
-------------------------
DDA- digital differential analyzer (DDA).
     Used for rasterization of lines, rectangles and polygon.

Rasteriation:convert vextor image into raster image(in pixels).

Equations:
Xi=Xi-1 + 1,
Yi=Yi-1 + 1.

Procedure:
1.X1!=X2, Y1!=Y2
2.cal. dx=x2-x1 and dy=y2-y1.
3.if(dx>=dy){
	step=dx
	}
  else{
	step=dy
	}
4.Xin=dx/step & Yin=dy/step.
5.x=x1+0.5 & y=y1+0.5.
6.for(k=0;k<step;k++){
	X=X+Xin
	Y=Y+YiN
	putpxel(x,y)
	}

Slope intercept of line:y = mx + b (where m and b are real numbers).

Advantage & disadvantage of DDA.
Advantage:
-Simplest algo., does not require special skills.
-Faster method for calculating pixel position.
Disadvantage:
-The algorithm is orientation dependent. Hence end point accuracy is poor.
-Rounding-off in DDA is time consuming.
